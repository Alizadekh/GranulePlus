          <h2>vision</h2>
          <p>
            Plastic recycling companies are all responsible for improving the
            environment and having a clean world. To this end, the style of
            waste disposal must change. Life without waste is not easy and it
            requires modern knowledge and equipment. It must be ensured that no
            resources are wasted and that everything capable of returning to the
            production cycle is recovered. We have entered this field with the
            slogan of <strong>“We give new life to plastic”</strong>. We are
            glad that we have become a customer-friendly company in this field
            by providing first-class services to them.

            “Plastic recycling company” is a broad term, so I need more
            information to understand what you’re looking for. Here are some
            possibilities:
          </p>
          <h4>Types of plastic recycling companies</h4>
          <p>There are many types of plastic recycling companies, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Material recovery facilities (MRFs): These facilities sort and
              process recyclable materials, including plastic, from households
              and businesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Processors: These companies convert recycled plastic into new
              products, such as bottles, bags, and clothing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manufacturers: These companies use recycled plastic to make new
              products.

          <h4>Benefits of plastic recycling</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reduced pollution: Plastic recycling helps to reduce the amount of
              plastic that ends up in landfills and incinerators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conservation of resources: Plastic recycling conserves natural
              resources, such as oil and water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of jobs: The plastic recycling industry creates jobs in
              the collection, sorting, processing, and manufacturing of recycled
              plastic.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges of plastic recycling</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contamination: Plastic recycling facilities can be contaminated
              with other materials, such as food and paper, which can make it
              difficult to recycle the plastic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Economics: The economics of plastic recycling can be challenging,
              as the price of recycled plastic can fluctuate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public awareness: Many people are not aware of the importance of
              recycling plastic or how to do it properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
